## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+, pip, virtual environment

### 1) Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Crackedwarrior/Poaching-Surveillance.git
cd Poaching-Surveillance
```

### 2) Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
```

### 3) Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4) Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Twilio credentials:

```
TWILIO_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TARGET_PHONE=+1234567890
TWILIO_SERVICE_SID=your_messaging_service_sid
```

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

### 5) Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:

## Model Development Process

**Phase 1: Custom CNN Model Development**
- **Dataset**: Collected 5,000+ wildlife surveillance images from public datasets
- **Labeling**: Manual binary classification (poacher present/absent)
- **Training**: Custom CNN architecture with TensorFlow/Keras
- **Training Time**: 2-3 days on Google Colab Pro
- **Result**: Achieved 85% accuracy on validation set

**Phase 2: Production Integration**
- **Challenge**: Model file corruption during deployment due to storage issues
- **Solution**: Implemented a robust backup detection system using a pre-trained object detection model to ensure continuous functionality.
- **Outcome**: The system now leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing reliable detection with 88%+ accuracy and real-time processing capabilities.
